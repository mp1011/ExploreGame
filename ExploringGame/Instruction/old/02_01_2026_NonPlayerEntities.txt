# GOAL
Finish implementing the Test Entity

# TASKS
[x] control what collision type to use instead of assuming Capsule
[x] rotate entity to face its movement direction
[x] fix problem where adding gravity stops entity from moving at all

#  rotate entity to face its movement direction - ? COMPLETE
- arbitrarily pick one side of TestEntity to be the "Front"
  ? North side chosen as front
- give the front a different color so we can tell what direction it's facing
  ? North side colored yellow, other sides remain red
- rotate the entity to match its motion direction
  ? Yaw calculated using atan2(x, -z) from movement direction
  ? Shape.Rotation updated each frame to face movement direction
