# GOAL
Implement non-player entities with their own behaviors

# MODEL
An entity has the following attributes:
- a Shape (describes their behavior, position, and rotation)
- a Behavior (runs once per frame)
- Motion (via an EntityMover)
- Collision Detection

# PREP WORK
- look at how all of this is done for the Player
- identify how we can generalize this for non-player entities

# ANALYSIS OF PLAYER ENTITY
Current Player Implementation:
1.	Shape/Position:	The Player class implements IWithPosition (provides Position and Rotation)
	- Player implements ICamera for view matrix generation
	- Position and Rotation are updated every frame
	- NPCs don't need camera views, and unlike the player they will have a physical Shape with which to capture their position and rotation
2.	Behavior (runs once per frame):
•	PlayerMotion class handles the player's frame-by-frame behavior
•	Located in Update() method, processes input and updates motion targets
•	Handles mouse look, keyboard movement, jumping, and fly mode
3.	Motion (via EntityMover):
•	EntityMover is a generic class that works with any IWithPosition entity
•	Uses AcceleratedMotion for smooth acceleration/deceleration
•	Integrates with Jitter2 physics engine via RigidBody
•	Updates entity position from physics body each frame
4.	Collision Detection:
•	CollisionResponder subscribes to RigidBody collision events
•	DetectFloorCollision is added as a collision response for the player
•	EntityMover creates a physics capsule for the player
How Shapes Already Handle Entity-like Behavior:
The codebase already has a pattern for shapes with behavior:
•	IControllable interface: Shapes can create controllers
•	IActiveObject interface: Controllers have Initialize(), Update(), Stop() lifecycle
•	Examples:
•	Door with DoorController (animated doors)
•	PhysicsTestShape with PhysicsTestShapeController (moving physics objects)
•	LightSwitch with LightSwitchController (interactive switches)
Key Insights for Generalization:
1.	EntityMover is already generic - It accepts any IWithPosition, not just Player
2.	Shape Controllers already exist - Many shapes use the IControllable/IActiveObject pattern
3.	Collision system is reusable - CollisionResponder can be added to any EntityMover
4.	The main difference - Player has input-driven behavior, while NPC entities would need AI-driven behavior


# BASIC TESTING ENTITY - ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- create a simple entity to demonstrate the concept of non-player entities
- appearance is a unit sphere, colored red
- collides with walls
- move slowly in a straight line directly at player (no pathfinding, just direct line)

# CURRENT TODO
- fix motion of testing entity
- fix appearance of testing entity (create sphere maker)
- fix physics shape to match (currently hard-coded to use Capsule)
