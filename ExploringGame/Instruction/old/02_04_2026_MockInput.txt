# GOAL 
Mock player input for unit testing

# TASK
- create a MockPlayerInput class that implements IPlayerInput
	- this should be placed in the ExploringGame.Tests project
	- in the Update method, increment a frame counter
- create an InputEvent record with the following properties:
	- FrameNumber: int
	- Key: GameKey
	- IsPressed: bool
	- MouseDelta: Vector2?
- give MockPlayerInput a list of InputEvents
- in the test Player_WalksForward_StaysInRoom, create a single InputEvent for pressing the forward key on frame 1

# How MockPlayerInput should interpret events
- each frame, check the events that match the frame number
- if the event is a key press, add that key to the list of pressed keys.
	- that key should remain pressed until MockPlayerInput sees another event of the same GameKey where IsPressed=false

# QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
1. CenterMouse Behavior
IPlayerInput has a CenterMouse(GameWindow) method. In the mock, should this:
•	Do nothing (no-op)?
•	Or should it do something specific for testing?
	- for now, have it do nothing
2. Multiple Events Per Frame
If there are multiple key events on the same frame, should they all be processed, or just the last one?
	- process all events for that frame
