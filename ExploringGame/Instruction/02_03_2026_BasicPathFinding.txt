# GOAL
Add basic pathfinding to the Test Entity so it "chases" the player regardless of location

# SUB-GOALS
- Test Entity will not get stuck on corners
- Test Entity will move around obstacles
- If player is in a different room, or even a different floor, Test Entity will find its way to where the player is

# UPDATES FOR TESTING
- when in "FlyMode", the Test Entity will stop moving
	- this will let us test pathfinding where the player is far away


# TECHNICAL APPROACH
- combination of Raycast + Avoidance and Waypoint Graph
- Waypoints generated based on room layout
- entity will use raycast when within the same room and Waypoint otherwise

## Waypoints
- place waypoints at center of each object which inherits from Room
- join waypoints using RoomConnection
- represent Waypoints as a connected graph. Later we'll enhance this graph to add more information such as locked doors.

## Doors
- at this point in development, doors are not treated as obstacles as the Test Entity will be able to push them open. This will be addressed later.

## General Approach
1. Try Raycast. If there is a straight line of sight, move in that direction
2. If Raycast fails, cast a few more rays in offset directions. Pick one that will get the entity closer to the player.
3. If all raycasts fail, use Waypoint graph to find a node path to the player.
4. Change the "target" to the appropriate Waypoint and repeat.

# RESEARCH
- How can we do raycasting?
	- look into _world.DynamicTree.RayCast()
