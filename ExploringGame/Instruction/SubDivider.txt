Let's try a different approach. Rather than thinking about packing right triangles, let's think in terms of grid points.

# GOAL
Split a triangle into multiple triangles along a specific grid plane so that we can apply texture coordinates.

# INPUT
- source triangle (3D)
- grid size (Vector2)
- grid origin (Vector3)

# PROCEDURE
- extend a planar grid along the plane where the triangle lies, where size of each cell is specified by "grid size".
	- it is not important which axis we consider U and which V
- take all vertices from this grid which lie on our original triangle
- create new triangles out of the vertexes from the original triangle and the vertexes of the grid, such that we get a collection of triangles
which occupies the same space as our original tiles, but now includes all of the points that lie on the grid boundaries

# END RESULT
- we now have vertexes that can map to the edges of our tiled texture, giving us the ability to cleanly apply a texture
