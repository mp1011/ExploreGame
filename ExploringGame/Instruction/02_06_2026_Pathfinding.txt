# GOAL 
Simplify the pathfinding code to make it easier to try new approaches

# TECHNICAL APPROACH
1. Create a class PathFinderTarget
	- this will have an IWithPosition for the target
	- it will also have a TimeAway property that will increment while the entity is far from the target
2. PathFinder will have a PrimaryTarget and CurrentTarget, both being PathFinderTarget instances
	- "CurrentTarget" is the target that the entity is actively moving toward
3. Start by setting "CurrentTarget" to "PrimaryTarget"


# PATHFINDING LOGIC
1. Check Line of Sight to Primary Target
	- If Yes - set CurrentTarget to PrimaryTarget
2. Check Line of Sight to Current Target
	- if Yes - move toward CurrentTarget
		if entity has reached current target, change CurrentTarget to PrimaryTarget
