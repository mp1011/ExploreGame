# GOAL
Generate flat decals we can place on walls, using ShapeStamps

# MODEL
- WallDecalStamp : ShapeStamp 
	- generates a 1x1 two-triangle quad with a pure white texture
	- original orientation isn't important because it will be rotated into place

- WallDecal : StampedShape<WallDecalStamp>
	- has a Side property and a Placement2D property which determine its position relative to its parent
	- will be rotated and translated so that it sits exactly on the wall, facing into the room 
	

# RENDERING
- use a RasterizerState with a DepthBias
- add RasterizerState as a nullable property of ShapeBuffer, so the renderer can optionally use it when drawing that buffer

	
# QUESTIONS 
Q: What should Placement2D represent?
	- this should represent the offset between the sides of the wall and the sides of the decal in world units.
	- orientation is based on the wall's side from the perspective of someone standing in the center of the room
	- for example, for a West wall, the "left" direction is South, the "right" direction is North
	- assume wall decals are only on north, south, east, and west walls, and the walls are axis aligned

Q: Wall Positioning Logic
When a WallDecal is created with a Side and parent Room:
•	Should it automatically calculate its position to sit on that wall face?
•	Should it be flush with the wall (same position) or use the depth bias only?
•	Should it inherit the parent's world matrix and apply an offset?
A: 
	- The decals should be placed immediately so that it is flush with the wall on the given side. 
	- we use depth bias so that we can place the decal exactly on the wall without z-fighting

Q: DepthBias Value
What should the DepthBias value be?
•	-0.0001f (typical value)? YES

Q: Orientation
"Facing into the room" - should it:
•	Use the wall's inward normal?
•	Be rotated 180° from the wall's outward face?
A: imagine the decal is like a poster hanging on the wall
