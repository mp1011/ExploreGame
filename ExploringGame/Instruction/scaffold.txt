# Premise

This will be an exploration-based game through strange, impossible and abstract geometry. Otherwise, there are no plans and the game will form organically.

To start, create a simple 3D environment with basic movement controls, with a first-person camera. Assume the perspective is from an ordinary person walking
through a strange landscape.

# Starting Room
A 128 square foot box, with a white ceiling, blue walls, and a dark green floor. There a soft light source on the ceiling which is barely enough to illuminate the room.

# Texture
Generate a random, rough looking gray texture which we can apply colors to in game. Apply this texture to all surfaces.
