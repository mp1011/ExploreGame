# GOAL
Improve our ability to test code by adding assertions that can run while the game simulation is running, rather than only being able to assert after the game finishes.

# TASKS
1. Add an optional parameter to TestGame where we can specify a testing lambda
	- lambda inputs: instance of TestGame, and a GameTime representing the simulated game time
	- lambda output: an enum with one of the following values: FAIL, PASS, CONTINUE
2. In the Update method of TestGame, execute the testing lambda each frame
	- if the result is FAIL, stop the game and mark the test as failed
	- if the result is PASS, stop the game and mark the test as passed
	- if the result is CONTINUE, do nothing and let the game continue running
	- if the game loop ends without the test lambda returning PASS, mark the test as failed
3. Use this to implement another test in LightSpiritTests, which asserts that the phase eventually changes to "BreakIn"
