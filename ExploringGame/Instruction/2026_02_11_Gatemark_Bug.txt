# PROBLEM
We want Gatemarks to only appear on walls, but we aren't checking if the wall is present at the location of the Gatemark. 
This results in Gatemarks sometimes appearing over room boundaries or over windows.

# CURRENT APPROACH (which does not work)
- we treated "walls" as a combination of Room + Side and assumed if there was geometry on that side, there was a wall
- however this didn't account for a wall having holes, such as windows or doorways 

# SOLUTION
- the Gatemark Manager will take into account the actual geometry of a room by building a simpler copy of the room
- this will occur once upon initialization

# TASKS (all within the GatemarkManager class)
1. On initialization, go through each Room in the world segment and call Build with QualityLevel.Basic
	- this is enough to know where the windows and doorways would be, but doesn't waste time building complex geometry
	- store these triangles for later use
2. When placing a gatemark, check that all vertices of the gatemark are within the triangles of the wall
	- if there aren't, try a new position
	- try at most 5 times before giving up


# QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Q. Placement2D to 3D Coordinates
How do I convert a Placement2D (Left, Top, Right, Bottom) into actual 3D world coordinates for the gatemark's 4 corners?
•	Do I need to use the Room's position, size, and side orientation?
•	Is there existing helper logic for this conversion?
A. WallDecal already has a method to convert to world coordinates. At that point, you can just do a check to see if those points overlap any of the triangles of the room

Q. Point-in-Triangle Test
For checking if a gatemark corner is "within wall triangles":
•	Should I project the 3D triangles and point onto a 2D plane aligned with the wall?
•	Or is there a simpler approach given that walls are axis-aligned?
•	Should a point be considered "in" if it's in ANY triangle on that side?
A. No need. As stated in the previous answer, the WallDecal's "CalculateTransform" tells you where it is in 3D Space

Q. Alternative Position Generation
When retrying placement (up to 5 times):
•	Should I try random positions on the same wall?
•	Or use a systematic grid (e.g., 9 positions: center + 8 around it)?
•	What's a reasonable spacing/offset for attempts?
A. Let's just try a new random position on a new random wall.

Q. Failure Handling
After 5 failed attempts:
•	Return null from SpawnGateMark() and continue?
•	Or mark that wall as unusable and remove it from eligible walls?
A.	Don't mark the wall as unusable, just don't produce a Gatemark

Q. Triangle Storage Structure
Should I store:
•	Dictionary<Room, Triangle[]> (all triangles per room)?
•	Dictionary<(Room, Side), Triangle[]> (filtered by side)?
•	Something else?
A. Filtered by side is good.

Q. After creating a GateMark (which extends WallDecal), how do I get the 4 corner positions in 3D space?
A. Calculate this from Position, Size, and Rotation

Q. For the point-in-triangle test - since walls are axis-aligned, should I:
•	Project everything to 2D (remove one axis based on the Side)?
•	Or do a full 3D point-in-triangle test?
A. Do full 3D as walls may not always be axis aligned later in development

# ROUND 2 REFACTOR
- the "try randomly and check overlap" doesn't seem to be working, so let's try something else
- let's compute the "quads" of each wall out of the triangles
	- a quad here is just a 4-vertex polygon made up of the triangles of the wall. 
	- most of the time this will be two triangles
	- to find quads, first separate the triangles by side (we only want to group triangles of the same side)
	- find which triangles are joined together by shared vertices, and this will define our quads
- store these quads, as opposed to the Room+side combo we are currently using
- keep only the quads big enough to fit a Gatemark
- when we want to place a Gatemark, pick a random quad and place the Gatemark in a random position within that quad
