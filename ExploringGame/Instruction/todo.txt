[x] refactor movement out of Game1
[x] basic collision with walls
[x] basic collision with obstacles
[x] connecting rooms 
	[x] render
	[x] remove face on overlap
	[x] connecting room test has single "world" shape, connecting rooms are not children of eachother but of it
	[x] collision aware of current room
	[x] allow player to pass through (forced side)
	[x] allow player to pass through (any side)
	[x] connecting room at any position
	[x] works regardless of relative size
[x] proper input
[x] accelerated motion
[x] gravity / jumping
[x] floor height differences
	[x] render side

[x] fix textures bleeding around corners
[x] find ways to make textures continuous across surfaces (not perfect)
[x] option to repeat textures
	[x] make repeatable in gimp

[x] easier way of defining structures?
[x] ability to rotate shapes after creation

[ ] moving objects
	[x] rotating cube
	[x] moving object
	[x] hinged doo
		[x] open via interaction

[x] proper collision detection
	[x] create correct collider walls for joined rooms


[x] fix player motion
	[x] disregarding gravity
	[x] implement gravity separately
	[x] implement jump
	[x] jump aware of when player on floor (kind of)
	[x] player y speed should be 0 when floor hit

[ ] resume basement office map
	[ ] desks rotated correctly
	[ ] collision bodies also rotated
	[ ] player able to fit through hall             


[ ] easier way to place rooms (by specifying either the left or right edge)
[ ] see if we can adjust n,s,e,w as long as rotation is multiple of 90
