[x] refactor movement out of Game1
[x] basic collision with walls
[x] basic collision with obstacles
[x] connecting rooms 
	[x] render
	[x] remove face on overlap
	[x] connecting room test has single "world" shape, connecting rooms are not children of eachother but of it
	[x] collision aware of current room
	[x] allow player to pass through (forced side)
	[x] allow player to pass through (any side)
	[x] connecting room at any position
	[x] works regardless of relative size
[x] proper input
[x] accelerated motion
[x] gravity / jumping
[x] floor height differences
	[x] render side

[x] fix textures bleeding around corners
[x] find ways to make textures continuous across surfaces (not perfect)
[x] option to repeat textures
	[x] make repeatable in gimp

[x] easier way of defining structures?
[x] ability to rotate shapes after creation

[x] moving objects
	[x] rotating cube
	[x] moving object
	[x] hinged doo
		[x] open via interaction

[x] proper collision detection
	[x] create correct collider walls for joined rooms

[x] fix player motion
	[x] disregarding gravity
	[x] implement gravity separately
	[x] implement jump
	[x] jump aware of when player on floor (kind of)
	[x] player y speed should be 0 when floor hit

[x] resume basement office map
	[x] desks rotated correctly
	[x] collision bodies also rotated
	[x] player able to fit through hall
	[x] physics engine for door

[x] boiler room
	[x] door
	[x] curved shape for boiler

[x] improve ability to define layout in code
	[x] separate theme into its own class
	[x] easier way to define alignments of adjacent rooms

[x] controllable lights
	[x] control via switch
	[x] multiple lights
	
[x] easier way to place rooms (by specifying either the left or right edge)

[x] angled walls
	[x] working collision

[x] steps
	[x] final step adjusts to meet target floor height
	[x] stair room needs to render with S/N sides ommitted
	[x] stair walls need not render on the inner side
	[x] add a room connection to the upper room and verify it looks right
	[x] stairs need sloped ceiling

[x] world segment transitions
	[x] one-way transition
	[x] player backs out
	[x] colliders properly loaded
	[x] active object state preserved
