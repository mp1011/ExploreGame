# GOAL
Emit more helpful debug information to the screen to better show how each phase is unfolding

# TASKS
1. Create a new method in IPhaseHandler called DebugDescribe which returns a string
2. Add this string to the message we show in Debug2
3. In AbsentPhase there is no new information, so DebugDescribe returns empty string
4. In BreakinPhase, show the number of gatemarks and the room+side of the most recent gatemark (if any)
